## Description

Implement a simplified single-chat interface with an app library system. Remove all multi-session complexity and provide a clean, isolated experience for each app project.

## Details

### Phase 1: Remove Multi-Session Code ✅
- Removed ChatSidebar component usage from app/page.tsx
- Removed session switching logic
- Removed sessionData state management
- Simplified to single active chat state

### Phase 2: Create App Library System ✅
- Created `lib/storage/app-library.ts` for managing saved apps
- App structure:
  ```typescript
  interface SavedApp {
    id: string
    name: string
    description?: string
    template: string
    code: any // Fragment code
    messages: ChatMessage[]
    createdAt: string
    updatedAt: string
    sandboxConfig?: any
    lastSandboxId?: string
  }
  ```

### Phase 3: Implement Library UI ✅
- Created `/library` page showing all saved apps
- Cards display app name, template, message count, dates
- Actions: Open, Export, Delete
- Export/Import functionality for sharing

### Phase 4: Update Main Chat Interface ✅
- Added "New App" button to start fresh
- Added "My Library" button to access saved apps
- Added app name input field
- Added "Save" button to save current app
- Auto-save every 30 seconds when app is active

### Phase 5: Ensure Isolation ✅
- Each app maintains its own message history
- No state bleeding between apps
- Sandboxes are closed when switching apps
- Clean state when creating new apps

## Test Strategy

Created comprehensive unit tests in `lib/storage/__tests__/app-library.test.ts`:
- Test app creation and retrieval
- Test app updates maintain isolation
- Test deletion functionality
- Test export/import features
- Test message isolation between apps

Created test page at `/test-library` to verify:
- Apps are properly isolated
- No bleeding between sessions
- Export/import works correctly
- Library operations function as expected

## Agent Notes

Implementation complete. The app now has:
- Single chat interface (no sidebar)
- App library for saving and managing projects
- Complete isolation between apps
- Export/import functionality
- Auto-save capability
- Clean, simple UX

Build passes successfully with only ESLint warnings (no errors).
