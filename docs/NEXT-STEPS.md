# Next Steps for Fragg

## What We've Accomplished âœ…

1. **Identified the Core Problem**: Apps were taking 30-60 seconds because we were building full dev environments for simple previews
2. **Researched Solutions**: Studied how Claude Artifacts achieves instant preview using iframe + CDN React
3. **Created Master Plan**: Comprehensive architecture redesign with progressive enhancement
4. **Built Proof of Concept**: Instant preview system that loads simple React apps in <2 seconds
5. **Integrated with Existing System**: Smart detection automatically uses instant preview when possible

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Enable Instant Preview in Production
- [ ] Remove the E2B dependency for simple apps
- [ ] Update the main chat flow to use instant preview by default
- [ ] Add telemetry to track success rates

### 2. Fix the AI Generation
Currently, the AI still generates code with imports like:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
```

We need to update the prompts to generate CDN-friendly code:
```javascript
const { useState } = React // React is global
// Use Tailwind classes instead of component libraries
```

### 3. Implement Smart Routing
Create a triage system that determines app complexity:
- **Instant tier**: Simple React/HTML apps â†’ Use instant preview
- **Fast tier**: Apps needing npm packages â†’ Use Sandpack
- **Full tier**: Apps needing backend â†’ Keep E2B

## Next Week Priorities

### 1. Multi-Agent System
Implement the orchestrator pattern from the master plan:
- Triage agent (Gemini Flash) - determines complexity
- Planning agent (Claude Sonnet) - creates task breakdown  
- Implementation agents (GPT-4o-mini) - parallel code generation
- Assembly agent (Gemini Flash) - combines results

### 2. Hot Reload & Diffs
- Implement the hot reload system for instant updates
- Use the existing CodeDiffer class properly
- Target <500ms for all code changes

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Start all apps with instant preview
- Upgrade to sandbox only when user needs it
- Seamless transition without losing state

## Month 1 Goals

### 1. Performance Targets
- **New app generation**: <5 seconds (currently 30-60s)
- **Code iterations**: <500ms (currently 5-10s)
- **Library app loading**: <100ms (currently 10-30s)

### 2. User Experience
- Remove all timeouts
- Show progressive loading states
- Never leave user waiting without feedback

### 3. Scale Preparation
- Implement caching at all levels
- Use CDN for common libraries
- Minimize server-side processing

## Technical Debt to Address

### 1. Simplify Template System
Current templates are overly complex. Consider:
- Single flexible template that adapts
- Progressive enhancement from simple to complex
- Remove heavy boilerplate

### 2. Remove Unnecessary Complexity
- Multiple sandbox managers trying to solve same problem
- Over-engineered AI orchestration
- Complex version management

### 3. Focus on Core Experience
- Fast app generation
- Instant iterations
- Reliable preview

## Success Metrics

Track these weekly:
1. **Average time to first preview**
2. **Iteration speed (edit to preview)**
3. **Success rate (no timeouts)**
4. **User satisfaction (would they use again?)**

## The Vision

Fragg should feel like magic:
- Ask for an app â†’ See it instantly
- Make a change â†’ See it immediately  
- Open from library â†’ Use it like a native app

We've proven this is possible with the instant preview POC. Now it's time to make it the default experience.

## Action Items for Tomorrow

1. **Test the instant preview** at `/test-instant-preview`
2. **Update AI prompts** to generate CDN-friendly code
3. **Create simple demo video** showing <2 second app generation
4. **Plan rollout strategy** for replacing E2B with instant preview

The foundation is built. Now let's deliver the "wow" experience users deserve! ðŸš€
