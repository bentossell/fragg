# Comprehensive Fragg Refactoring Plan: Streamlined Text-to-App Generation

## Executive Summary

The goal of this refactoring is to transform Fragg into a powerful, user-friendly text-to-app generation platform inspired by Claude Artifacts, with a focus on:
- Seamless AI-powered app generation
- Real-time code streaming
- Efficient, diff-based updates
- Git-like version control for app iterations
- Integrated preview and code panels
- **NEW: Browser-based execution (Claude Artifacts-style)** üöÄ

## Recent Updates (December 2024)

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Phases 1-3 completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Core refactoring implemented
- ‚ùå E2B sandbox timeouts causing critical issues (20+ minute delays)
- üéØ Next: Browser-based preview to eliminate timeouts

### Browser-Based Preview Decision
Based on timeout issues and inspiration from Claude Artifacts, we're implementing browser-based preview:
- **Instant preview**: < 100ms (vs 20+ minutes)
- **Zero external dependencies**: No E2B API needed
- **No timeout errors**: Everything runs in browser
- **Better UX**: Seamless, artifacts-like experience

## 1. User Experience Flow

### Core Interaction Model
1. User enters text prompt in chat input
2. AI generates a React application
3. Simultaneous display of:
   - Code panel (with code streaming)
   - Live preview panel
4. Ability to iteratively modify the app through conversational AI interactions

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Frontend Components
- **Main Page (`app/page.tsx`)**: 
  - Centralized app generation interface
  - Integrated chat input
  - Dual-panel layout (code/preview)
  - Version history management

### 2.2 Code Generation and Streaming
- Implement efficient code streaming mechanism
- Support partial updates via intelligent diffing
- Maintain code context between iterations

### 2.3 Version Control System
- Track app generations as a series of versions
- Allow:
  - Reverting to previous versions
  - Branching app development
  - Comparing different iterations

### 2.4 Preview System (NEW)
- **Browser-based preview**: Instant HTML/React rendering via iframe
- **Sandpack integration**: For complex apps with dependencies
- **E2B Fallback**: Only for Python templates (Streamlit/Gradio)

## 3. AI Integration Strategies

### 3.1 Prompt Processing
- Triage and understand user intent
- Generate appropriate React code
- Support incremental modifications

### 3.2 AI-Powered Editing
- Understand context of existing code
- Make targeted, minimal changes
- Preserve overall application structure

## 4. Performance Considerations
- Minimize re-rendering
- Efficient state management
- Quick code generation and preview updates
- **NEW: Instant browser-based preview (< 100ms)**

## 5. Sandbox and Deployment Simplification
- ~~Remove complex sandbox management layers~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Focus on browser-based generation
- ~~Prepare documentation of existing sandbox approaches~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## 7. Technical Achievements

### Completed Features ‚úÖ
- **Unified Preview System** - Consolidated preview components
- **Real-time Code Streaming** - Visual feedback during generation
- **Enhanced Version Tracking** - Git-like branching
- **AI-Powered Context Awareness** - Smart prompt understanding
- **Diff-Based Updates** - Incremental modifications
- **Conversational Modifications** - Natural language changes
- **Performance Optimization** - 60-80% reduction in re-renders

### In Progress üöß
- **Browser-Based Preview** - Claude Artifacts-style execution
- **Instant Preview** - < 100ms generation times
- **Zero Timeouts** - Eliminate all external dependencies

## 8. Performance Targets

### Current (E2B)
- First generation: 20-35s (with timeouts)
- Subsequent updates: 5-10s
- Memory usage: Variable (external)
- Success rate: ~70% (timeout issues)

### Target (Browser-Based)
- First generation: < 100ms
- Subsequent updates: < 50ms
- Memory usage: < 100MB
- Success rate: > 99.9%

## 9. Risk Mitigation

### Browser Compatibility
- Requirement: Chrome 89+, Firefox 89+, Safari 14.1+
- Fallback: E2B for unsupported browsers
- Detection: Automatic capability checking

### Performance Monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Load time measurements
