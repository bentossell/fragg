We need to create a new markdown document `docs/SANDBOX-ARCHITECTURE-RECOMMENDATION.md`.  
Content must cover: executive summary, phased approach, technical architecture per phase, handling different app types, speed optimizations, persistent state, migration from E2B, cost/complexity, tech recommendations with pros/cons, timeline & milestones.  

Will structure with top-level headings for each requested part and concise yet thorough details.
