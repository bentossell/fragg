# Instant Preview Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated instant preview functionality into the main FragmentPreview component, making it the default preview method for simple React applications while maintaining full sandbox support for complex apps.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Core Preview Component (`/components/fragment-preview.tsx`)
- Integrated instant preview detection logic
- Added automatic fallback to sandbox preview for complex apps
- Checks for React-based templates and simple code patterns
- Transforms code for CDN-based execution
- Displays appropriate loading states

### 2. Updated Preview Integration (`/components/preview.tsx`)
- Updated imports to use `FragmentPreview` instead of `FragmentPreviewInstant`
- Properly passes fragment data with code, template, and file_path

### 3. Updated Enhanced Preview (`/components/enhanced-preview.tsx`)
- Similar updates to use the new unified `FragmentPreview` component
- Maintains all enhanced features like version history and sharing

## How It Works

### Instant Preview Detection
The system automatically detects when instant preview can be used by checking:
1. Template is React-based (`nextjs-developer` or `react`)
2. Code contains React components
3. No complex imports (only react, react-dom, lucide-react allowed)
4. No server-side code (`use server`, `getServerSideProps`)
5. No file system or Node.js specific code

### Code Transformation
When instant preview is used:
1. Import statements are removed (dependencies loaded via CDN)
2. Lucide React icons are transformed to use global objects
3. Auto-render logic is added for App components

### User Experience
- **Fast Preview**: Simple React apps preview instantly without sandbox creation
- **Visual Indicator**: Shows "⚡ Instant Preview (CDN-based)" when active
- **Automatic Fallback**: Complex apps automatically use full sandbox
- **Loading States**: Clear messaging about what's happening

## Benefits
1. **Speed**: Instant preview for simple apps (no sandbox wait time)
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces sandbox usage for simple previews
3. **Better UX**: Users see results immediately for basic React components
4. **Smart Detection**: Automatically chooses the best preview method
5. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing fragment and result structures

## Testing
To test the instant preview functionality:
1. Generate a simple React component (e.g., "Create a counter button")
2. Observe the instant preview appears with the ⚡ indicator
3. Generate a complex Next.js app with API routes
4. Observe it falls back to sandbox preview automatically

## Future Improvements
- Extend instant preview support to Vue.js
- Add more CDN libraries support
- Cache transformed code for faster subsequent loads
- Add error boundaries for better error handling
