# Stage 1: Basic Local Setup - COMPLETE (Enhanced)

## What was implemented:

### 1. AI SDK + OpenRouter Integration (Following sdk-or.md)
- Added OpenRouter provider to `lib/models.ts` with proper headers
- Created `lib/ai-config.ts` with model presets for different use cases:
  - Fast/cheap models for simple tasks
  - Balanced models for app generation
  - Powerful models for complex apps
  - Cost-optimized (:floor) and speed-optimized (:nitro) variants
- Uses Vercel AI SDK with OpenRouter for best DX and reliability

### 2. Enhanced Model Configuration
- Updated `lib/models.json` with popular models via OpenRouter:
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (regular and :nitro turbo variant)
  - Claude 3 Haiku (regular and :floor cheapest variant)
  - Claude 3 Opus
  - GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini
  - Gemini Pro/Flash 1.5
  - Mistral Large
  - Llama 3.1 70B/8B
  - DeepSeek V3
  - Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B
- Kept fallback direct options for OpenAI and Anthropic

### 3. Environment Setup
- Updated `.env.template` to prioritize OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- Created `.env.local` for local development
- Installed all project dependencies
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY is now the primary requirement

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated CLAUDE.md with:
  - OpenRouter as primary provider info
  - Stage verification process requirement
  - Updated environment variables section
- Added verification rule for all future stage implementations

## Benefits of AI SDK + OpenRouter:
1. Single API key for 400+ models
2. Automatic failover between providers
3. Cost optimization (routes to cheapest available)
4. Superior streaming and DX from AI SDK
5. No markup on inference costs

## Next Steps (Stage 2):
- Test the app generation with different models
- Implement AI SDK injection into generated apps
- Create basic window.AI object for apps using the pattern from sdk-or.md

## To Test:
1. Add your API keys to `.env.local`:
   - E2B_API_KEY=your-e2b-key
   - OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Try generating an app with different models
4. Test the :nitro and :floor variants
5. Verify streaming works correctly
