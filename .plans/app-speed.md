Summary of Proposed Improvements
1. Speed Optimization - Achieving <10 Second App Generation
Problem: App generation currently takes 30-60 seconds
Solutions:

Sandbox Pool: Pre-warm 3 sandboxes per template type to eliminate cold starts
Parallel Processing: Start sandbox creation and code generation simultaneously
Streaming: Use Vercel AI SDK's partial streaming mode
Incremental Updates: Apply diffs instead of full rewrites for edits
Key Implementation: Create SandboxPool class that maintains warm sandboxes ready for immediate use

2. Chat Sessions with Persistent Sandboxes
Problem: Each edit request recreates everything from scratch, causing sandbox not found errors
Solutions:

Database Schema: Add chat_sessions and chat_messages tables to Supabase
Session Management: Each chat maintains its own sandbox_id, last_code, and template
Sidebar UI: Add ChatGPT-style sidebar showing all user's chat sessions
Persistent Sandboxes: Use Sandbox.reconnect() to reuse existing sandboxes
Incremental Changes: Only update changed code, not full rewrite
Key Implementation: Create ChatStore class for session persistence

3. Hybrid CDN Approach for Ultra-Fast Loading
Problem: npm install takes significant time for common frontend libraries
Solutions:

CDN-First Templates: Create HTML templates that load React/Vue/etc from CDN
Smart Dependency Resolution: Automatically categorize dependencies as CDN-compatible or npm-only
Pre-bundled Combinations: Cache common dependency bundles (e.g., React + Tailwind + Radix UI)
No Build Step: For simple apps, serve static HTML with CDN scripts
Edge Caching: Cache popular app templates for instant delivery
Key Implementation: Create FastTemplateGenerator that chooses optimal loading strategy

Expected Results:

CDN-based apps: 2-5 seconds (vs 30-60 seconds)
Updates to existing apps: 3-7 seconds (vs 30-60 seconds)
Zero npm install time for frontend-only apps
Persistent sandboxes eliminate "sandbox not found" errors
